# GMF Investments Challenge – Week 11

Welcome to the **Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments Challenge** repository. This project aims to leverage **time series forecasting** techniques to enhance **portfolio management** strategies. We focus on three key assets:
- **Tesla (TSLA)**
- **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**
- **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**

---

## Project Overview

1. **Task 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Analysis**  
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized data types, and removed duplicates.  
   - **EDA:** Explored trends, volatility, and seasonal patterns using rolling statistics and time series decomposition.

2. **Task 2: Time Series Forecasting**  
   - Developed forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM) to predict future stock prices.  
   - Split data into training and testing sets, optimized model parameters, and evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

3. **Task 3: Forecast Future Market Trends**  
   - Generated 6–12 month forecasts for TSLA, BND, and SPY.  
   - Analyzed predicted trends, potential volatility, and confidence intervals.

4. **Task 4: Portfolio Optimization**  
   - Combined historical and forecasted returns to optimize a simple portfolio (TSLA, BND, SPY).  
   - Used Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, balancing risk and return.
